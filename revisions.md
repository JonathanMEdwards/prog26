We thank the reviewers for their effort and comments. The chair identified the need for four major revisions:

1. Add evidence beyond single examples for the 4 problems addressed by the work.
2. Add a systematic discussion of what is necessary to support further operations, and what the limitations are.
3. Provide a deeper explanation of the conclusions from previous study.
4. Provide more details of the evaluation with a discussion.

Accordingly, we have extended and restructured the evaluation aspects of the paper. Before there was an Evaluation section at the end that listed the eight challenge problems identified in our prior paper (Schema Evolution in Interactive Programming Systems), assigning a Pass/Fail grade to each. Now we have distributed discussion of case studies throughout the paper. These include the four challenge problems that were deemed to have been solved, but also variants and alternative problems that attest to the practical applications of Baseline and also identify some of its current limits.

A combined Evaluation and Discussion section now ...

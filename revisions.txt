We thank the reviewers for their effort and comments. The chair identified the need for four major revisions:

1. Add evidence beyond single examples for the 4 problems addressed by the work.
2. Add a systematic discussion of what is necessary to support further operations, and what the limitations are.
3. Provide a deeper explanation of the conclusions from previous study.
4. Provide more details of the evaluation with a discussion.
